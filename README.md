# MachineLearningDoorbell
Repository compiling the progress of our Software Engineering 2 Project, a Machine Learning Doorbell. 

- Hardware: RaspberryPI 4 Model B for computing, 
- Software: Python, RasPICamera, and VLC (we dabbled a bit in TensorFlow and PyTorch as well)
Our goal is to develop a dataset full of our classmates and recognize each individual's face with a neural network. After recognizing an individual's face, the LED strips will signify that they can enter, and it will play a sound effect of choice.
