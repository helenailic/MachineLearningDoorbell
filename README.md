# MachineLearningDoorbell
Repository compiling the progress of our Software Engineering 2 Project, a Machine Learning Doorbell. 

This repository documents how we developed a dataset full of our classmates and recognized each individual's face with a neural network. After recognizing an individual's face, a sound effect will play automatically to signal the teacher.

**Hardware:**
  1. RaspberryPI 4 Model B for computing
  2. RasPi HD HQ Camera - 12MP
  3. Flex cable (ours is 1 meter long)
  4. 6mm 3MP Wide Angle Lens for RasPi
  5. 3.5A USB-C Power Supply for Pi
  6. Any USB Powered Speakers (5VDC 1A peak)
  7. Customized 3D designed camera stand
     -Recommend using Tinkercad for 3D design 
  8. SD Card (16 gb or 32 gb)

  -Process-
  
  1. Set up RasPi camera
     -Can follow this video: youtube.com/watch?v=T8T6S5eFpqE

**Software:**
  1. Python
  2. RasPICamera
  3. VLC (library for speakers)
  4. RealVNC (to access Pi via PC)
     -Downlaod VNC Viewer and VNC Server on both Pi and PC
     -Very simple setups via internet
  5. RasPi imager of choice
  *(we dabbled a bit in TensorFlow and PyTorch as well)*
  
  -Process-
  1. Image card (this is ultimately saving your work from the RasPi onto the PC)
     -Download Raspberry Pi Imager
     -Insert SD card into PC
     -Install recommended 32-bit RasPi OS
     -Select SD card
     -Write
  2. Download this repository on RasPi
     -Follow this file to setup and maintain Git on Pi: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWng-q4m3h4TwRcapSAPxexKST6AjQMfA9iVv2GRnwM/edit#
